# web-server-project

I spent about 4 hours on this project, a lot of my time was spent familiarising myself with Ansible and working out a quick solution that could showcase some of my skills. To be honest, I am unhappy with some of my methods and if I could spend more time on this I would like to have it all in AWS so I would create an EC2 instance for my Jenkins master, and properly set up pem keys so the SSH solution is more secure. It was enjoyable to setup my own CI solution from scratch, I may revisit this in future. :)
